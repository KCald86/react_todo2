//This file will house the schemas for both resources and categories for our create/edit form. To bring in a simple validation implementation, we are going to use Yup by installing it into our app (npm install yup) see implementation below

//Yup will work in tandem with Formik, which is an npm package that creates and stores form inputs for each item
//(catName, catDesc) that we need to capture in our forms. (npm install formik)

/* This is what we need for category POST. We will have inputs for eachin the form
    {
        'catName' : 'Test',
        'catDesc': 'Test desc'
    }
*/
